			The <strong>Software University</strong> (SoftUni) was founded with the idea of creating an innovative and modern educational centre that would develop true professionals in the world of programming. For us, as well as for the entire software industry, the practical skills are of utmost importance.
		</p>
		<p>
			For these reasons we are applying a <i>learning-by-doing</i> model, providing our students with programming training as well as hands-on practical experience and knowledge of the most sought-after modern technologies, thus helping them start their successful careers as software engineers.
